# Simon Says Game

This project is a simple Simon Says game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game generates a sequence of colors that the player must remember and repeat. With each level, the sequence grows longer, challenging the player's memory and attention.


## How To Play

1. Start the Game: Press any key to start the game.

2. Watch the Sequence: The game will highlight a sequence of buttons in a specific order. Pay attention to the sequence.

3. Repeat the Sequence: Click the buttons in the same order as the sequence shown.

4. Level Up: If you successfully repeat the sequence, you advance to the next level where an additional color will be added to the sequence.

5. Game Over: If you click the wrong button, the game ends, and your score (the highest level reached) will be displayed. Press any key to restart.
## Features

- **Interactive UI**: Buttons flash to indicate the sequence.

- **Responsive Design**: The game layout adjusts to different screen sizes.

- **Visual Feedback**: The buttons provide visual feedback on user interactions.
- **Dynamic Leveling**: Each level increases the sequence length, making the game progressively harder.
## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the game.
- **CSS**: For styling the game elements and animations.
